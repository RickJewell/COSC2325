The Raspberry Pi 3 uses a cortex-A53 processor that implements the ARMv8-A architecture. 
****************************************************************************************

The ARM architecture is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture with the following features:

	• A large uniform register file.

	• A load/store architecture, where data-processing operations only operate on register contents, not directly on memory contents.

	• Simple addressing modes, with all load/store addresses determined from register contents and instruction fields only.


The majore classes of instucions supported by the Arm archeitectuer are:

	* Branches, Exception generating, and System instructions.

	* Loads and stores.

	* Data processing on immediates, registers, SIMD (vectors) , and floating points.
		- This includes arithmetic and logical operations that can be preformed each.
